== Reporting Security Issues ==
Mozilla relies on the security community to help secure our products and websites by reporting security issues. Our preference is to receive '''[[Security/Fileabug|bug reports]]''' via our bug tracking system Bugzilla, however [https://www.mozilla.org/security/#For_Developers emailing security@mozilla.org ] (preferably encrypted) is also an option.

Details on the way we classify security bugs can be [[Security Severity Ratings|found here]].
