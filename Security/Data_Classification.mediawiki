We want to emphasize the way we intend this classification scheme is based solely on who the intended audiences of a particular document is meant to be, not based on the content contained within the document.<br>

<br>

The data classification is intended to allow Mozilla to operate effectively in the open while protecting sensitive information.

These data classification levels use the colors of the [[Security/Standard Levels|Standard Levels]]. <br>

<br>

If you think there is information that is improperly classified, we encourage you to work with the document owner, using this page as a reference. If you are unable to come to a resolution, please reach out to the Infrastructure Security team via Slack (@infrasec) or [[mailto:infrastructuresecurity@mozilla.com | email]]. <br>

<br>

Updates to this page should be submitted to the [https://github.com/mozilla/wikimo_opsec/ source repository on github].
Changes are detailed in the [https://github.com/mozilla/wikimo_opsec/commits/master commit history].

|
When sharing or distributing data, documents, etc. you are responsible for setting and changing a classification label.
While it is required for all Google Workspace documents, it is strongly advised that you use them with any tools and communications systems where Mozillians may share
information.  (e.g.: text documents, attachments to emails, Matrix topics, and other digital media documents).

= Deciding how to classify  =

''The list of examples of how to label data is not an exhaustive list and serves an an indication on how to ensure the data classification labels are clearly communicated.''

There are always at least two people involved with exchanging confidential information:

* The '''Owner''' is the person who created the file. The '''Owner''' and '''Discloser''' are often the same person, but not always.
* The '''Discloser''' is the person who provides/sends the information to the Recipient.
* The '''Recipient''' is the person who receives the information.

When in doubt, it's always best to classify at the most specific classification. 

== All new documents, box.com, etc. ==

'''Label''' every document with its appropriate classification at the top of the document if possible. When possible, we recommend
using the header feature of the document. 

== Google Apps ==

'''Label''' every document (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drawings, etc.) with its appropriate classification by utilzing the required label functionality and if its not possible, attempt to insert it into the body of the document itself.
* For Docs, we recommend including the label in the header of the document.
* For Slides, we recommend including the label in the master slide so that it shows on all slides.
* For Sheets, we recommend creating a dedicated sheet (the tabs at the bottom of the page) either called "Data Classification" or the name of the classification for the entire file. In that new sheet, indicate the data classification.

== Wikimo (mediawiki), GitHub public repos ==

* All documentation is by default <span style="background-color: #cccccc; border-radius: .25em; color: #000000; display:inline-block; font-weight: bold; margin: .1em 0; min-width: 6em; padding: .05em .5em; text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;">Public</span> on https://wiki.mozilla.org
* No confidential information may be hosted on the wiki.

== Email subject lines ==

* <span style="background-color: #ffd351; border-radius: .25em; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block;
* font-weight:bold;margin: .1em 0; min-width: 6em; padding: .05em .5em; text-transform: uppercase; text-align:
* center;">Mozilla Confidential - Specific Workgroups and Individuals Only</span> information '''must''' be labeled in the subject line and should not be forwarded without the original senders express permission.
* For other emails, optionally label subjects with the appropriate classification. This one is up to you, but we encourage you to label emails when the subject is sensitive and it is important to alert recipients.

== Matrix ==

Set your Matrix channel topic to start with the classification label. This is also recommended for public channels.

Also ensure that non-public channels are protected by password or channel access control.

Remember that <span style="background-color: #ffd351; border-radius: .25em; color: #594300; display: inline-block;font-weight: bold; margin: .1em 0; min-width: 6em; padding: .05em .5em; text-transform: uppercase; text-align:
center;">Mozilla Confidential - Staff and NDAâ€™d Mozillians Only</span> and <span style="background-color: #ffd351;border-radius: .25em; color: #ffffff; display: inline-block; font-weight: bold;margin: .1em 0; min-width: 6em; padding:
.05em .5em; text-transform: uppercase; text-align: center;">Mozilla Confidential - Specific Workgroups and Individuals Only</span> '''may not''' be shared on Matrix.

Ex: "PUBLIC | This is a channel to discuss anything you like about Firefox".

== Zoom, Hello, Hangouts, Skype and other video conference tools ==

* When using video conferencing, if this is not a public call - ensure that only the people who need to know the information have access to the video conference and chat.
* Verify the list of participants and verbally announce if you're going to share any non-public information.

== Code and configuration deployments ==

When committing or deploying code that handles credentials:

* Ensure that the credentials are stored in a separate file (if possible encrypted).
* Optionally label the file with a comment mentioning it's data classification label (either inside the file or as a file attribute, or even in the file name if it makes sense)
