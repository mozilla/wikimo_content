'''Only non-default settings are listed in this document'''.

Most default OpenSSH settings that are security-related already provide good security, thus changing them is at your own risk and is not documented here.
For example, these guidelines assume only SSH protocol 2 is configured in the server, and SSH protocol 1 is disabled.

See <code>man sshd_config</code>, <code>man ssh_config</code> for more information on specific settings if you nevertheless need to change them.

=== '''Multi-Factor Authentication''' (OpenSSH 6.3+) ===
Recent versions of OpenSSH support MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication). Using MFA is recommended where possible.

It requires additional setup, such as using the [http://www.nongnu.org/oath-toolkit/ OATH Toolkit] or [https://www.duosecurity.com DuoSecurity].

== Ciphers and algorithms choice ==
* When CHACHA20 (OpenSSH 6.5+) is not available, AES-GCM (OpenSSH 6.1+) and any other algorithm using EtM (Encrypt then MAC) [http://blog.djm.net.au/2013/11/chacha20-and-poly1305-in-openssh.html disclose the packet length] - giving some information to the attacker. Only recent OpenSSH servers and client support CHACHA20.

* NIST curves (<code>ecdh-sha2-nistp512,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp256</code>) are listed for compatibility, but the use of <code>curve25519</code> is [https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ generally preferred].

* SSH protocol 2 supports [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange DH] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman ECDH] key-exchange as well as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy forward secrecy].

The various algorithms supported by a particular OpenSSH version can be listed with the following commands:

<source code="bash">
$ ssh -Q cipher
$ ssh -Q cipher-auth
$ ssh -Q mac
$ ssh -Q kex
$ ssh -Q key
</source>

== Configuration ==
If you have a file containing known_hosts using RSA or ECDSA host key algorithm and the server now supports ed25519 for example, you will get a warning that the host key has changed and will be unable to connect. This means you will have to verify the new host key.

The following configurations expect a recent OpenSSH client, as updating OpenSSH on the client side is generally not an issue.

=== '''Modern''' ===
This configuration is less compatible and you may not be able to connect to some servers which use insecure, deprecated algorithms.
Nevertheless, modern servers will work just fine.

=== '''Intermediate''' (connects to older servers)  ===
This configuration can connect to older OpenSSH servers which run old or intermediate configurations.

</source>

== Key generation ==
Large key sizes are used as SSH keys are not renewed very often (see also [[Security/Key_Management]]).
{{note|
DSA and RSA 1024 bit (or lower) keys are considered weak and should be replaced as soon as possible.
}}

Don't hesitate to create multiple different keys for different usages. In particular, never mix your personal and
Mozilla keys.

<source code="bash">
# RSA keys are favored over ECDSA keys when backward compatibility ''is required'',
# thus, newly generated keys are always either ED25519 or RSA (NOT ECDSA or DSA).
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_mozilla_$(date +%Y-%m-%d) -C "Mozilla key for xyz"

# ED25519 keys are favored over RSA keys when backward compatibility ''is not required''.
# This is only compatible with OpenSSH 6.5+ and fixed-size (256 bytes).
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_mozilla_$(date +%Y-%m-%d) -C "Mozilla key for xyz"
</source>

=== Protection of user keys ===
* Protected by strong passphrase.
* Never copied to another system than your own workstation/personal physical disks/tokens.
* Use SSH forwarding or SSH tunneling if you need to jump between hosts. '''DO NOT''' maintain unnecessary agent forwarding when unused.

=== Protection of machine keys ===
When SSH keys are necessary for automation between systems, it is reasonable to use passphrase-less keys.
* The recommended settings are identical to the user keys.
* The keys must be accessible only by the admin user (root) and/or the system user requiring access.
* Usage of machine keys should be registered in an inventory (a wiki page, ldap, an inventory database), to allow for rapid auditing of key usage across an infrastructure.
* The machine keys should be unique per usage. Each new usage (different service, different script called, etc.) should use a new, different key.
* Only used when strictly necessary.
* Restrict privileges of the account (i.e. no root or "sudoer" machine account).
* Using a ForceCommand returning only the needed results, or only allowing the machine to perform SSH-related tasks such as tunneling is prefered.
* Disable sftp if not needed as it exposes more surface and different logging mechanisms than SSH (and thus scp) itself.

File: <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>
<source>
Match User machine_user
    Subsystem   sftp  /bin/false
</source>

====  Multi-factor bypass setup for machine keys ====
Machine keys do not play well with multi-factor authentication as there is no human interaction.

* All logins from machine accounts should be protected by an additional authentication layer (VPN, another machine, etc.).
* All logins from machine accounts are only allowed within the private IP-space, and if possible, only the relevant machine source IPs should be accessible.

</source>

=== Auditing your existing SSH keys ===

Existing keys are generally stored in <code>~/.ssh/</code> (Linux/OSX) or <code>%APPDATA%</code> (Windows).
Look for <code>id_{rsa,ed25519,ecdsa,dsa}</code>,  or legacy <code>identity</code> files.

==== Display SSH keys information ====

# You may run this for any key file that you have.

== SSH agent forwarding ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! <span style="color:red;">'''ATTENTION'''</span>
|-
| SSH Agent forwarding exposes your authentication to the server you're connecting to. By default, an attacker with control of the server (i.e. root access) can communicate with your agent and use your key to authenticate to other servers without any notification (i.e. impersonate you).<br />For this reason, one must be careful when using SSH agent forwarding. Defaulting to always forwarding the agent is strongly discouraged.<br /> Note also that while the attacker can use your key as long as the agent is running and forwarded, he cannot steal/download the key for offline/later use.
|}

SSH forwarding allows you to jump between hosts while keeping your private key on your local computer. This is accomplished by telling SSH to forward the authentication requests back to the ssh-agent of your local computer. SSH forwarding works between as many hosts as needed, each host forwarding new authentication request to the previous host, until the ssh-agent that holds the private key is reached.

[[File:Ssh forwarding.png]]

On each host, two environment variables are declared for the user enabling ssh-agent:
* '''$SSH_AUTH_SOCK''' declares the location of the unix socket that can be used to forward an authentication request back to the previous host.(ex: /tmp/ssh-NjPxtt8779/agent.8779). Only present if using SSH agent forwarding.
* '''$SSH_CONNECTION''' shows the source IP and port of the previous host, as well as the local IP and port. (ex: 10.22.248.74 44727 10.8.75.110 22).

To use ssh-agent, add the flag <code>-A</code> to your ssh commands:
<source code="bash">
$ ssh -A user@ssh.mozilla.com
</source>

You can set the following configuration parameter in your local ssh configuration at ~/.ssh/config.
<source>
Host ssh.mozilla.com
    ForwardAgent yes
</source>

=== Hardening the Agent forwarder ===
It is possible to require confirmation every time the agent is used (i.e. when you connect to a server through the SSH agent) by using the <code>-c</code> flag:

<source code="bash">
# First, remove the key from the agent if it's already loaded:
$ ssh-add -d ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# And re-add it with the -c flag:
$ ssh-add -c ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</source>

It is also possible to lock the key in the agent after a configurable amount of time, this can be done either for all keys when starting the agent, or per key when adding the keys to the agent with the <code>-t</code> flag:

<source code="bash">
# Keep all keys decrypted/useable in memory for 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
$ ssh-agent -t 1800
</source>

<source code="bash">
# First, remove the key from the agent if it's already loaded:
$ ssh-add -d ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# Re-add it, with the -t flag to keep this specific key decrypted/useable in memory for 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
$ ssh-add -t 1800 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</source>

{{note|
There are also some third-party patches for various OpenSSH clients that will notify you visually when the agent is being used.

These are not officially supported and may require you to recompile OpenSSH.

}}

=== Safer alternative to SSH agent forwarding ===

It is possible to directly forward ports for single jumps instead of forwarding the agent. This has the advantage of never exposing your agent to the servers you're connecting to.

For example, you can add these lines to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>
<source>
Host *.mozilla.com
ProxyCommand ssh ssh.mozilla.com -W %h:%p
</source>
This will automatically forward the SSH connection over ssh.mozilla.com when you connect to a mozilla.com SSH server.

== Key material handling ==
Key material identifies the cryptographic secrets that compose a key. All key material must be treated as <span style="color: orange">RESTRICTED</span> data, meaning that:
* Only individual with specific training and need-to-know should have access to key material.
* Key material must be encrypted on transmission.
* Key material can be stored in clear text, but only with proper access control (limited access).

This includes:
* OpenSSH server keys (<code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*key</code>)
* Client keys (<code>~/.ssh/id_{rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519}</code> and <code>~/.ssh/identity</code>).
* <code>/etc/ssh/moduli</code> also contains prime numbers and generators for use in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and must be handled like key material.

== Client key size and login latency ==

In order to figure out the impact on performance of using larger keys - such as RSA 4096 bytes keys - on the client side, we have run a few tests:

On an idle, i7 4500 intel CPU using OpenSSH_6.7p1, OpenSSL 1.0.1l and ed25519 server keys the following command is ran 10 times:

<code>time ssh localhost -i .ssh/id_thekey exit</code>

Results:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Client key !! Minimum !! Maximum !! Average
|-
| RSA 4096 || 120ms || 145ms || 127ms
|-
| RSA 2048 || 120ms || 129ms || 127ms
|-
| ed25519 || 117ms || 138ms || 120ms
|}

Keep in mind that these numbers may differ on a slower machine, and that this contains the complete login sequence and therefore is subject to variations.
However, it seems safe to say that the latency differences are not significant and do not impact performance sufficiently to cause any concern regardless of the type of key used.
