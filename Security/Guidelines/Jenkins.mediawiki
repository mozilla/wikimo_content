The goal of this *DRAFT* document is to help operational teams with the configuration of Jenkins, a continuous integration/delivery application.

All Mozilla sites and deployment should follow the recommendations below.  The Enterprise Information Security (Infosec, formerly
OpSec) team maintains this document as a reference guide for operational teams.

Updates to this page should be submitted to the [https://github.com/mozilla/wikimo_opsec/ source repository on github].
Changes are detailed in the [https://github.com/mozilla/wikimo_opsec/commits/master commit history].

= Jenkins-CI =
== HTTP ==
=== Transport Encryption ===
*TODO* - Basically, see SSL/TLS guidelines
=== Sensitive Path Restrictions ===
*TODO* - Provide a list of sensitive paths and maybe some example configurations on how to restrict paths in different browsers
=== Password Masking ===
*TODO* - Ensure masking is enabled on all passwords.  In cases where this is not enabled, enable it and consider rotating the credentials.
=== Authentication ===
*TODO* - LDAP and MFA strategy vs. user/pass, don't allow users to sign up, always require auth
=== Authorization ===
*TODO* - Use a matrix based security (this gives you options)
== CSRF Protection ==
*TODO* - enable this out of the box

== SSH ==
=== Transport Encryption ==
*TODO* - Basically, see OpenSSH guidelines (use key auth)
=== Tunneling ===
*TODO* - Have users tunnel their traffic for sensitive paths

== Architecture ==
*TODO* - Discuss the trust model in Jenkins a bit further
=== Security Zones ===
*TODO* - Don't run different trust levels on the same build target (ie. test/build/sign/push)
=== Job Isolation ===
*TODO* - Don't run anything on the master node, use slaves and containers for better OS isolation and repeatability
=== Secret Management ===
*TODO*

== Maintenance ==
=== Advisory Notification ===
*TODO* - Jenkins provides a mailing list for anyone who's managing a Jenkins instance.  They also provide pre-notification for advisories and you can sign up to receive them here for planning purposes.
=== Security Updates ===
*TODO*
=== Job Pruning ===
*TODO*
=== Job Creep ===
*TODO*
