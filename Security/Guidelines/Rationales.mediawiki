|<div id="shared-passwords">Shared passwords</div>
|Shared passwords are passwords that more than one person knows or has access to. They're discouraged beacause
* Use of them makes auditing access difficult as multiple users appear in audit logs as one user
* Revoking access to a subset of the users of a shared password requires a password change that affects all usrs

|<div id="decentralized-user-account-management">Decentralized user account management</div>
|Decentralized user account management refers to user account management which is not driven by the source of truth for the user's account. Examples of this are
* Manual user account creation by administrators
* Automated user account creation from scripting or configuration management that creates accounts based on a static list of users
This practice is discouraged because
* When a user's access status changes due to leaving the company or changing teams, the associated change in the system which uses decentralized user account management is not automatically made resulting in unintended system access
* When a user changes an attribute of their account in the centralized account management system, for example their email address or password, that change is not reflected in the systems which use decentralized user account management. Conversely when the user changes an attribute in the systems which use decentralized user account management, that change is not propogated to the centralized account management system.

|<div id="mfa">Multi-factor Authentication</div>
|Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity for a login or other transaction. Requiring the use of MFA for internet accessible endpoints is encouraged because by requiring not only something the user knows (a knowledge factor like a memorized password) but also something that the user has (a posession factor like a mobile phone) the field of threat actors that could compromise the account is reduced to actors with physical access to the user.

|<div id="nsm">Network Security Monitoring</div>
|Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is the practice of monitoring raw network traffic in order to detect intrustions or abnormal behvaior. The use of NSM is encouraged because it can
* identify when a host has been comporised by the network traffic it emits
* understand the commonalities in a distributed network attack
* provide incident responders with data needed to quickly diagnose security issues
