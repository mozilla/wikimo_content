=== Mozilla IAM FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) ===

==== '''Q''': ''What is Mozilla IAM?'' ====

[https://github.com/mozilla-iam/mozilla-iam Mozilla IAM] stands for Mozilla's Identity and Access Management. It's the
system that Mozilla manages logins to various web properties and systems.

Usually, you'd use Mozilla IAM as Mozilla Staff, or as a contributor with access to the tools and resources Mozilla uses day to day.
An example of that would be our Discourse instance: http://discourse.mozilla.org/

Mozilla IAM is '''not''' Firefox Accounts, Persona or part of any Mozilla Product.

==== '''Q''': ''How do I login with Mozilla IAM?'' ====

Mozilla IAM supports various login methods, such as "LDAP" (Staff logins), GitHub social login, Google social login and email login (which we call "passwordless").
Certain methods support and enforce the use of two-factor authentication (2FA) and may grant access to more sensitive services.

==== '''Q''': ''Why is my login failing with an error message telling me to use "GitHub/Google/LDAP/etc" instead?'' ====

If your login (your primary email address used by Mozilla IAM) matches an existing account which provides higher
security, we require that you use the most secure method available to login.

Example: LDAP uses two-factor authentication to verify a user's identity and is safer than using email login
("passwordless").

==== '''Q''': ''Why do you support email login ("passwordless") if it's less safe than other methods?'' ====

Sometimes all you want to do is post a comment on a public forum. For that, we often need to provide a valid identity, but we also want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute.
Email login ("passwordless") is our current solution for this use case. Some applications we provide may not provide this login method, for example when the application require more secure methods.

==== '''Q''': ''I would like access to specific groups, such as the NDA group, but it requires me to use a different login method, why?'' ====

We only allow login, or authentication methods that can verifiably require two-factor authentication (2FA) in order to join any group that may grant you access to data that is not public, such as what we call [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Data_Classification STAFF CONFIDENTIAL data].
At the time of writing, only LDAP, Google accounts that use our LDAP backend (i.e. '''not''' '@gmail.com' accounts) and GitHub account support this functionality.

Example: you could get a GitHub account with two-factor authentication enabled. Here's some documentation on how to do this: https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/

If more authentication methods add support for this in the future and seem to be otherwise safe, we'll gladly allow them as well.

==== '''Q''': ''I used to use email login ("passwordless") to access [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Data_Classification STAFF CONFIDENTIAL data] with my NDA'd account, but I lost access'' ====

We no longer allow email logins to access non-PUBLIC data (see previous FAQ item as well).
In order to regain access, please use a login method that supports two-factor authentication (2FA) such as GitHub. Here's some documentation on how to do this: https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/

==== '''Q''': ''Where is the source code, documentation, etc. for all Mozilla IAM Projects?'' ====

Glad you asked! it's all here: https://github.com/mozilla-iam/mozilla-iam/

==== '''Q''': ''I found a bug, vulnerability, issue, etc. Where do I report it?'' ====

Please report all public bugs and issues here: https://github.com/mozilla-iam/mozilla-iam/issues
For security vulnerabilities, please see https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/web-eligible-sites/ or email us at [mailto:security@mozilla.org security@mozilla.org]

==== '''Q''': ''How can I set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for my github account, using an app on my phone (Android/iOS/Blackberry)?'' ====

Two-factor authentication can be configured by using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) application, which automatically generates an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time. See configuration steps below.<br>
1.  Download one of these apps:
*For Android, iOS, and Blackberry: Google Authenticator
*For Android and iOS: Duo Mobile
*For Windows Phone: Authenticator
2.  In the upper-right corner of any github page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
   [[File:Github-settings.png|450px]]
3.  In the user settings sidebar, click Security.
   [[File:Github_-_security.png|150px]]
4.  Under Two-factor authentication, click Set up two-factor authentication.
   [[File:Github_-_set_up_2fa.png|400px]]
5.  On the Two-factor authentication page, click Set up using an app.
   [[File:Github_-_set_up_using_an_app.png|400px]]
6.  To enable two-factor authentication you must save your two-factor recovery codes in a safe place, such as a password manager, by clicking Download, Print, or Copy. Your recovery codes will help get you back into your account if you've lost access. After saving your codes, click Next.
   [[File:Github_-_recovery.png|450px]]
7.  Scan the QR code with your mobile device's app. After scanning, the app will display a six-digit code that you can enter on GitHub.
   [[File:Github_-_scan_barcode.png|400px]]
8.  The TOTP mobile application will save your GitHub account and generate a new authentication code every few seconds. On GitHub, on the 2FA page, type the code and click Next.
   [[File:Github_-_enter_passcode.png|400px]]
9.  Verify that a success message is shown
   [[File:Github_-_2fa_success_message.png|400px]]
10.  After 2FA has been enabled and you've saved your recovery codes, we recommend you sign out and back in to your account. In case of problems, such as a forgotten password or typo in your email address, you can use recovery codes to access your account and correct the problem.

==== '''Q''': ''How can I set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for my github account, without using an app on my phone?'' ====

If you would rather not install yet another app on your device, you can run the Firekey app (which is a 2-factor auth (TOTP) token generator for the Web) by browsing https://firekey.org/. <br>
1.  In the upper-right corner of any github page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
   [[File:Github-settings.png|450px]]

5.  To enable two-factor authentication you must save your two-factor recovery codes in a safe place, such as a password manager, by clicking Download, Print, or Copy. Your recovery codes will help get you back into your account if you've lost access. After saving your codes, click Next.
   [[File:Github_-_recovery.png|450px]]
6.  Get the secret key for your duo setup by either scanning the barcode (the URI generated should have the "secret" parameter) or by clicking the "enter this text code" link. Also, save this secret in a file. 
   [[File:Github_-_enter_text_code.png|450px]]
   [[File:Github_-_2fa_secret.png|300px]]
7.  Copy the 2-factor secret.<br>
8.  Navigate to https://firekey.org/ and add a new account. Enter a site name and paste the secret in "secret key" field, then click "Add".
   [[File:Firekey_-_add_account.png|450px]]
9.  Enter the provided number for the 2FA in github.

==== '''Q''': '' What happens if I lose access to my LDAP (aka leave Mozilla) and I still need to be able to login as a community member?'' ====

When the LDAP account goes away, we will de-provision that identity from your Auth0 identity. This way you will be able to log in using other authentication providers (e.g. Github, Google or passwordless email). In order to do that you should add at least one such "secondary identity" to your profile while you are a staff member.

==== '''Q''': ''I am a Mozilla staff member and I want to show my personal email address on my Mozillians profile. How do I do that?'' ====

1.  Login to mozillians using your LDAP credentials. <br>
2.  Navigate to mozillians profile settings page. <br>
3.  In Profile Identities section, Contact Identities sub-section shows the identities associated with your profile. 
In order to set a certain email to show on your mozillians profile, you need to click the "Show on Profile" button corresponding to that email.
